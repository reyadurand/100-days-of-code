# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 28, 2024

**Today's Progress**:  I've been working on learning Scanner better. I am in a bootcamp, but I feel like I need more help with some things. I need more in debpth help. I started learning more using Sololearn on my phone and on my computer. It has helped sooo much with understanding things. Today I used programiz.com/java-programming/scanner to help me understand scanner better. It has helped so much. I created a "Contact Info" small little program to log first, last name, phone number and birthday. 

**Thoughts:** I really feel like I'm the type of person who NEEDS to have every part of something I'm learning, completely explained to me in a step by step fashion or I'll feel lost pretty easily. Doesn't it work that way with a lot of us?! ;)

**Today's Progress**: I'm going through the Sololearn: Learn to Code for Java. I worked on User Input and Conditionals and The switch Statement. Nothing written. Just followed along with their practice lessons.  

**Thoughts**: The switch Statement is kind of difficult for me. Again, I need to have everything I'm learning explained to me in a step by step fashion. I'm trying though.



### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
